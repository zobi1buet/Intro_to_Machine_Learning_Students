The human brain is made up of neurons that are connected to each other, and a neural network aims to replicate that. How much this actually models a human brain is up in the air (I don't think it actually works anything like a real human), but it's ability to make predictive models is excellent. We have inputs, output(s), and some number of layers in between. This sounds complex, and it can be, but we can break it down into a few simple steps.\n",

    "<li> Output layer - the prediction that the network makes. This generates an actual prediction, just like any of our other models. \n",
    "<li> Weights - just like the slopes in regressions, we have weights that are multiplied by the inputs. Also just like regression, these weights are what the model learns to make its predictions.\n",
    "<li> Middle (hidden) layers - these are the layers that are in between the input and output layers. These layers are where the magic happens and are what allows a neural network to learn about our data so well. \n",

    "The basic process of training a neural network is also similar to regression:\n",

    "<li> The model, with the current weights makes a prediction. \n",
    "<li> The error of the prediction is calculated.\n",
    "<li> The errror is broken down and attributed back to each of the weights, in a process called backpropagation. This is just like gradient descent finding adjustments for the weights in a regression, but slighty more complex since we normally have several layers. \n",

The difference here is that we have multiple layers, each with its own set of weights. The more layers we add, the more ability the model has to learn relationships in the data. In a sense (this is a thought process, not a literal description) each layer is kind of similar to its own little logistic regression, and we layer them together like a boosting model to make improvements layer by layer.

    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> <b>Initialization:</b> set up the matrix of weights and a vector of bias values. Here they are initialized to a random bumber, in practice these are initialized using some smart method, configurable with a parameter. Each neuron connects to each other neuron, so there is a wight for each of those connections - a matrix of input size by output size. Each output has one bias value. \n",

The calculation itself is a dot product - which multiplies each input by its corresponding weight in the matrix automatically. This could be done by lots of loops, but this is more compact and efficient. Recall that each connection has a weight, so we end up with this large matrix. \n",
    "<li> <b>Backward Propagation:</b> this layer calculates the impact of the error stemming from each input X. This is done by calculating the gradient of the loss with respect to each input - thus allowing us to attribute portions of the output error to the different inputs. The calculation is done using the derivitive of the activation function and some math called the chain rule. Once we have this, we update all the weights and the bias so that we shrink our loss. \n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> If we look at the backwards propagation code, we can see that the actual math to calculate the gradient is a pretty simple implementation. We can perform the calculation by dot product of the error and the weights, and then multiply by the derivitive of the activation function. This is the gradient of the loss with respect to the input.\n",
    "    <li> The linear algebra details are a bit beyond what we need to cover, but the important thing is that this calculation is done for the matricies of weights and error, all the way back to the initial layer of weights. Because our neural networks tend to have a large number of neurons, in a large number of layers, this can add up to a lot of caclulations each round of traning - the matrix math that can execute these calculations is something that is optimized for speed in the library code. \n",

    "### Activation Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important parts of a neural network is the activation function. The activation function is what allows the network to learn non-linear relationships. Without an activation function, the network would be no more powerful than a linear regression. The activation function is applied to the output of each neuron, and it is what determines whether the neuron is \"on\" or \"off\". Prior to the output of each neuron being sent on to the next layer, the activation function is applied. If you're paying close attention, the output going into an activation function is just a linear regression - the sum of the features times their weight. The activation function changes this, and allows the neural network to be \"more\" than a complicated linear regression. In real applications, we usually have a few layers in our neural network, and the combination of multiple layers and activation functions allows us to learn very complex relationships. The term \"deep learning\" refers to networks that have lots of layers. \n",
    "\n",
    "This step is just like the sigmod step in a logistic regression - we have the raw value that comes into the function, the output is not that raw value, it is whatever that raw value translates to after the activation function is applied. If this wasn't applied, a multi-layer neural network could be decomponsed into a simple linear equation (with a bunch of linear algebra work). As well, each layer has an activation function, and they don't necissarily have to be the same one from layer to layer. In particular, we normally have a different activation function for the last layer of the network, one that will give us the output we want.\n",
    "\n",
    "![NN Steps](images/nn_steps.jpeg \"NN Steps\" )\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different activation functions, including the one that we are used to - the sigmoid. These activation functions are things that we can experiment with and tune like our hyperparameters. Some tend to be better suited for different types of problems, such as ReLU being common for image work and tanh being common for text processing, but there is no definitive answer. There are also considerations for computational efficiency, and some activation functions are more computationally expensive than others. For the most part we will start with the most common one for the type of problem we are doing, and then experiment with others if we feel the need. We'll look at these more later. If in doubt ReLU, or one of the slight variations on ReLU that we'll introduce later, is a solid choice. \n",

For regression, the final activation function is \"nothing\" or linear - we want the raw value. For classification, we want a sigmoid for two classes, like a logistic regression, or the softmax for more than two classes. This isn't an absolute rule, but a pretty reliable rule of thumb.\n",

Recall that one neuron creates a prediction (during FP) that is equal to w1*x1 + w2*x2 +... b; this does a sort of reverse execution of that - starting with the overall error and mapping it to each term. The error is effectively split into parts and each of the m*x terms and the b term is labeled as being accountable for some of it. Since the x values are the inputs, they can't change, so we modify the weights and bias to lessen the error - this is the gradient descent part. This gets repeated back through each layer until the first layer, then another FP begins with the new updated weights. The learning rate controls the size of the adjustments at each round.\n",

    "![Back Propagation](images/backprop.webp \"Back Propagation\" )\n",

    "This back propagation part is the key to the high accuracy ceiling that neural networks have when the data is large - we can tune each of many neurons specifically to their contribution of error. If we have enough data, we can get very accurate predictions. This is also the gradient descent process that we are used to from logistic regression. The difference is that we walk that process back through the entire network, through all the layers, and update the weights and bias all the way through. This can become computationally expensive, as we are doing partial derivitives on a bunch of (potentially large) matricies over and over, but the concept is simple - we are adjusting the weights to improve the error, or performing gradient descent."

    "##### Accuracy Note\n",
    "\n",
    "This may vary due to randomness and the specific settings I had in trials, but one thing that occurred several times here for me is that the overall accuracy between this larger model and the smaller one above were relatively similar, despite the loss being lower. This means that the model is internally \"more confident\" in the predictions it is making, even though they aren't all that much more correct overall. Think about a value that is True, and our predictions going from .6 to .85 - less loss, but same accuracy. This is likely a good thing overall, even if not directly reflected in the accuracy, as we can expect fewer samples that are close to the decision boundary, like we saw with support vector machines. However, this can also be a sign of overfitting - the model is learning the training data too well (as seen by the dropping loss) and not generalizing well to the test data (as seen by the similar accuracy). \n",
    "\n",
    "If we see this, it is reasonable to suspect that we may need to make some changes to the model's structure to get better results. We'll look into the details of this more when we use the Keras library, but we may want to try some method of regularization to prevent the model from learning so well on the training data that it doesn't generalize well. Exactly what works will again be a guess and test process. There is also a possibility that this is just the irreducible error in the data, and we can't do any better, but I kind of doubt it in this case. "

    "#### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "These results will vary depending on exactly what you added for layers, size, and activations, but we will generally see a couple of things as we add some more layers. First, we will see that the model is able to learn the data better. This is because we are adding more layers, and thus more logistic regression steps. Each layer is learning a different relationship from the data, and we are able to learn more complex relationships. Second, we should see more (it might not be a lot, it depends on the setup) learning as we progress through the rounds of training. This is because the capacity of our model to learn is far larger, we have more weights that can be combined in different combinations to deliver the best fit. The model will take longer to learn which combinations are best as it is doing that gradeint descent process. This is basically why large neural networks can take days or weeks to train, there is just a lot of math as the data sizes and the network sizes get large.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the learning rate, and the epochs you've allocated, there is likely a point at which the model's loss starts to flatten out from epoch to epoch. This is a sign that the model has learned as much as it can, and that it is just bouncing around the minimum of the loss function. We might be able to get past this point, but it will likely involve changing something in the model's structure or configuration, not just more training. In practice, monitoring the loss as training progresses, and stopping when we reach the minimal loss is one of the primary tools to optimize training, and we have some tools that make monitoring the loss from epoch to epoch easier.

    "### Complex Example - MNIST Images\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we are at least a little comfortable with the usage of neural networks, we can start to apply it to more useful applications, such as our old friends, the MNIST digits. Here we will make a larger model and we can also try a differnet activation function. One other difference to note is the \"to_categorical\" applied to the target y values. This works with the final layer of 10 output neurons - we get a softmax type (note: not actually softmax here) of output where there is a probability for being in each class. The output layer is often felxible like this in a neural network, depending on what we are doing. Here each output neuron is the probability of being in that class, we have 10, one for each digit. Our raw probabilities, which we'll print a few of below, are the probabilites of being in each class; note that those probabilities don't sum to 1, since each prediction is independent. We'd then need to add a function that is similar to \"argmax\", to choose the highest probability and assign a label. These details are cleaner and easier to handle with Keras, so don't get hung up on that part. With the library functions it is a bit more intuitive to deal with multiple output classes. The structure of our model will be similar to this, the middle layers will depend on whatever we add:\n",
    "\n",
    "![MINST](images/mnist_nn.jpeg \"MINST\" )\n",
    "\n",
    "Since these images, and the relationships in the data, are much more complex than the simple examples above, we should expect to see higher accuracy with more training become more visible here. More layers will also likely help, so try a few variations. In general, we can probably get really good accuracy here, it could be even better if we used more data to train, but it'll take a while. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> one big caveat here is that we don't have a softmax activation function coded for our simple model, so we don't have any activation functions that are appropriate for this exact scenario. We are using the sigmoid activation function on the output layer, which will technically give us a multi-label classifier - one that can label things as being in more than one class at a time. If we look closely at the output percentages, they don't total to 1, like we expect in a softmax; each prediction is it's own yes/no, so a very ambiguous image could be labeled as 2+ numbers, if each of the probabilities is over .5. We could also have some digits that are not classified as anything, if they are all <.5."

    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> Layers - we'll build networks with multiple layers, including some that differ from the straightforward layers here by implementing things such as regularization. \n",
    "<li> Neurons - we need to define the number of neurons in each of the layers we create. \n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> These two things combine to define the size, or capacity, of our neural network. In general, the larger the capacity of a model, the more complex relationships it can learn, but the more likely it is to overfit, and the more training data is needed. \n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "<li> Activation Functions - we will always need at least one activation function.\n",
    "<li> Loss Functions - we need to define the loss function that we will use to calculate error. \n",
    "<li> Training rounds - one of the key differences between neural networks and other models is the importance of how many rounds of training we want to run. \n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "    <li> Neural networks can often continue to learn during training for a long time, especially if we have a large capacity model with massive datasets. One of the main ways to get a good fitting model is to cut off training where we start to overfit\n",

    "These key factors in neural networks generally reflect what we are used to in the previous models, but with some added complexity. The basic idea of training accurate models remains the same, but the toolset is a bit more complex and open ended. In addition, neural networks introduce a little bit of \"magic\" in terms of their ability to learn during training - the large capacity that many of the neural networks have to learn can allow them to \"overcome/sidestep/recreate\" some of the work we do in optimizing other models. Especially as the size of our data grows, neural networks can internally do things like feature selection or feature extraction without us explicitly defining those steps."
